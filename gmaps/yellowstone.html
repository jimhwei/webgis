At the time of the arch's construction, President Theodore Roosevelt was visiting the park. He consequently placed the cornerstone for the arch, which then took his name.

        <p>
          Yellowstone is the first park that started the national parks movement
          during President Ulysses S. Grant's administration. Known for its
          stunning landscapes, hot springs and geysers, the park experiences
          roughly over 4 million visitors per year. The above interactive map is
          a collection of points of interests when visiting the national park.
