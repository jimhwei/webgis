Robert Reamer, a famous architect in Yellowstone, designed the immense stone arch for coaches to travel through on their way into the park. At the time of the arch's construction, President Theodore Roosevelt was visiting the park. He consequently placed the cornerstone for the arch, which then took his name.

        <p>
          Yellowstone is the first park that started the national parks movement
          during President Ulysses S. Grant's administration. Known for its
          stunning landscapes, hot springs and geysers, the park attracts
          roughly over 4 million visitors in a regular year. The above
          interactive map is a collection of points of interests when visiting
          the national park. Click on the icons to see what your next adventure
          holds.
